# AWS: Cloud Servers

## What a vertual machine is?

Computers are machines that perform hight-level computing operations. Computers contain components called the hardware, which are really complicated to deal with. However, there is a another components called the softawre that make dealing with hardware easy and intuittive. There is a special kind of software called operating system. This software is the interface to the hardware and deals direcyly with the components. Usually computers need only one of this operating system and it is all set. In the other hand, sometimes we need to setup more than one operating system for special purposes. 

Virtual machine is the process of having more than one operating system and making them working inside each other as if each was an individual machine on its own.

### Benefits of using multiple operating systems:

1. Testing other applications
2. Tryig new operating systems
3. Running old software that needs older operating system versions

### How to install Virtual Machines on the systemon

There is specialized pieces of software allow us to do so. They are called hypervisors. We can put several VM's on one comuter.

### Features

1. Fewer physical machines
2. Lower cost
3. Centralized management
4. Lower operating power

## What is Cloud Computing?

When wee need more virtual machines than our computer can handle, we rent other computers that allow us to use their computing power and VM's hypervisors to complement with our comupter. It is like having your computer but far away from you ot perform your computing tasks.

## Amazon EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle.

The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app. These are the steps of WRRC:

1. A user opens his browser, types in a URL, and presses Enter.
2. When a user presses Enter, the browser makes a request for that URL.
3. The request hits the router. The router maps the URL to the correct controller and action to handle the request.
4. The action receives the request and passes it on to the view.
5. The view renders the page as HTML.
6. The controller sends the HTML back to the browser. The page loads and the user sees it.

### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC?

Is is the computer that HTTP requests are sent and from where the response are received.

### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

When we deploy the application, we make it available online so people can go to its specific URL and benefit from the services it provides. Deploying involves storage and processing power to allow the application run as it is running on ones personal machine.

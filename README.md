Welcome to my webpage. I will tell you a bit about myself. I graduated with a medical science bachelor's degree and worked in a hospital right after graduation. 
<br> Five years later, I realized that I do not like what I do. And to be successful at what you do, you have to love it. I turned my interest to software development a year ago, and I started learning from the very basics.
<br>
I am so passionate about this field since I had succeeded in many computer programming events in middle school. I wrote my first lines of code when I was 12 years old. The inspiration I had that time kept me persistent in designing small applications for my computer science teacher, and I build ten different applications while he only asked me to do one. That is from where I realized I wanted to learn programming and software development. <br>
Writing code and cooperating with other developers is now the part of my life that I enjoy the most. I would sincerely want to keep going with the same motivation and spirit beyond what ordinary developers and community members would reach.

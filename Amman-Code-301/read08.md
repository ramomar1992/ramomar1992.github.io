# SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data or for stream processing in a relational database management system.

It introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command and it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record.

The SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control.

The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:

* Clauses, which are components of statements and queries.
* Expressions, which can produce either scalar values, or tables consisting of columns and rows of data.
* Predicates, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic or Boolean truth values and are used to change program flow.
* Queries, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria.
* Statements, which control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics.
* SQL statements also include the semicolon (";") statement terminator.

**Note**: Insignificant whitespace is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries.

Some statmenets in the language includes:

```sql

SELECT DISTINCT data_set FROM data_base_name 
WHERE (condition)s ORDER BY data_set ASC/DESC
LIMIT number_val OFFSET numerical_val

```

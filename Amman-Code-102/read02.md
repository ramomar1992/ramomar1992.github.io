# Growth Mindset

The growth mindset is the ability to manage your personal and professional life problems with a more creative and problem-solving way of thinking. The opposite of a growth mindset is the fixed mindset, which leaves people with self-doubt and frustration upon any problem they face. Let us compare these two mindsets from the perspective of different aspects of life:
<br>
* __Challanges__
<br>

If you have a growth mindset, you will think of a challenge as an opportunity to develop your skills and the ability to think more creatively about different problems then solve them with confidence.
<br>
* __Obstacles__
<br>

A fixed mindset believes that obstacles are where you should give up and leave tasks unsolved. In contrast, with a growth mindset, you will break these obstacles and pave the way for your advancement peacefully, focusing on your goals, not the obstacles themselves.

# Component Based UI

## React

React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.

React is used to build single page applications.

React allows us to create reusable UI components.

### Create React App

In order to learn and test React, you should set up a React Environment on your computer.

This tutorial uses the create-react-app.

The create-react-app is an officially supported way to create React applications.

If you have NPM and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by first installing the create-react-app.

## JSX

 JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that is recommended with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

JSX produces React “elements”.

### Benefits of JSX

React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.

React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

During the 1980s in the United States, the general community's lookout to computer science and tech people was leveraging men to be the people of computers. Although women built the first computer programs, when the personal computers gain their rise at the beginning of the 92s, it was looked at computers as toys for boys. In the future, people believed that women should not be involved much in the tech industry, and men have predominated computer science, engineering, and programming. 

Recent studies showed that diversity in companies is very important in many ways. It improves team innovations and allows the company to reach out to more groups of users. 

These are some reasons why CEO's should consider gender and ethnic diversity in their companies:

1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative 
2. Diverse companies perform better
3. Companies are losing out on great talent 
4. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base

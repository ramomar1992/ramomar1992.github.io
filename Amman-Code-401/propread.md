## Solving Problems

When we face a programming problem, we have to understand completely what the problem is. Solving problems is not an arbitral process. Solving problems is a gradual process that requires us to follow some steps to solve the problem eventually.

1. Read the problem at least two times.
2. Write the steps for solving the problem using pe and paper.
3. Optimize your solution with more fixes and try to make it more robust.
4. Write the steps to solve the problem with pseudo-code and comments.
5. Replace them with a real code.
6. Optimize your code and test it.

We have to spend over 70% of the time solving the problem on the first three steps. Understanding and analyzing the problem is the most important part of solving it because if you do not understand it, your solution will not be relevant to it.

## How to think like a programmer

Programmers are the people who solve the problem in a great way. These are the steps to think like programmers:

1. Understand exactly what is being asked
2. Plan your solution
3. Divide the big problem into many sub-problems and deal with each one
4. Connect the dots between the sub-problems to come up with the final solution to the big one
5. When you are stuck, debug your code and reassess the problem; perhaps you did not understand it completely, or there is a missing piece. If you can not find the solution go and search online
6. Practice more and solve more problems

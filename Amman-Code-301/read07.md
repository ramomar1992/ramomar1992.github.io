# REST

Rest is an architectural style to program web APIs that is very basic but very powerful.

It is a set of rules that was written by someone to simplify the writing of web services,

The API is short for the Application programming interface. Its main goal is to make computers connected to the web able to communicate and transfer information that is human-readable in a machine-readable way.

The concern of REST is to tell machines that other machines contain some sort of resources that might be needed from other machines. This is done using the URLs.

The other concern of REST is to handle verbally the requests that humans can understand and make machines communicate using the same concepts. Instead of having a different way to do multiple things, why not do them in the one way that turns to lead to the same result. Like GET, it is a common word that means to obtain the thing or the resources. Instead of giving different orders and commands to operations that result in obtaining the resources, we give all these operations the GET command. This approach makes computers smarter and allows them to connect with each other with minimal human intervention.

## The verbs that are used in RESTful applications:

* GET: to retrieve data
* POST: creates new data
* PUT: to replace an existing data
* PATCH: tp partially updating data
* DELETE: to delete the data
